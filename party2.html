Growing up my parents didn’t buy chips very often and dip was unheard of, unless it was salsa. So when game day rolled around it was the one time we were allowed to pick out our favorite bag of chips and dip. I think back to the not so wonderful selection that was available and how much it’s improved over the years.</p>
